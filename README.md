**End-to-End Text-to-Image Generation Pipeline using Diffusion Models**

---

**Overview:**

This project showcases an end-to-end pipeline for generating high-resolution images (2048 x 2048) from textual prompts describing individuals and their backgrounds. Leveraging state-of-the-art diffusion models, the pipeline ensures robustness, stability, and superior image quality compared to traditional GANs and VAEs. Below is a detailed breakdown of the experimentation process, findings, and evaluation of the pipeline.

**Familiarity with Diffusion Models:**

Diffusion models have been chosen for their superior performance in image generation tasks, surpassing traditional GANs and VAEs. They offer enhanced stability during training and mitigate issues like model collapse.

**Experimentation Process:**

1. **Platform and Setup:**
    - Platform: Jupyter notebook
    - Language: Python
    - Hardware: GPU (RTX 4090 24GB), CPU (i9-13700KF)
2. **Models Explored:**
    - Explored various AI/ML models on Hugging Face.
    - Selected **"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0”** for text-to-image generation and **“databuzzword/esrgan”** (RRDB_ESRGAN_x4.pth) for upscaling.
3. **Automatic Workflow:**
    - Developed an automatic workflow:
        1. Load model from Hugging Face.
        2. Input textual prompt.
        3. Generate and save image.
        4. Download and save upscaling model.
        5. Upscale generated image to 2048 x 2048.
4. **Image Generation from Text Prompt:**
    - Input: Text prompt describing a person and their background.
    - Utilized diffusion models to generate a 1024 x 1024 image.
5. **Upscaling:**
    - Employed super resolution to scale images from 1024 x 1024 to 2048 x 2048.

**Reporting and Findings:**

1. **Approach:**
    - Utilized Hugging Face models and pre-existing codes for upscaling.
2. **Experiments:**
    - Experimented with Google Colab, faced CUDA OUT OF MEMORY error, shifted to local Jupyter runtime.
    - Successful execution on workstation with specified specifications.
3. **Inferences:**
    - Inferences drawn directly from the notebook, allowing for prompt-based generation.
    
**Evaluation:**

1. **Effectiveness:**
    - Evaluated model effectiveness in achieving photorealism and prompt steerability.
    - Effectiveness adjustable via epochs and noise ratio.
2. **Creativity and Efficiency:**
    - Assessed pipeline creativity and efficiency in terms of resource utilization and computational complexity.
    - Requires substantial resources but delivers desired results.
3. **Results**: 
    - Prompt: "Middle-Aged Gentleman Standing on a Luxurious Yacht"
